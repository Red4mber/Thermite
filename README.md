# Thermite: Offensive Rust

## A Rust Malware development and EDR/AV Evasion Learning Project

This is a **learning project** aimed at exploring advanced topics in Windows internals, malware development and EDR/AV
evasion techniques. It is written entirely in Rust and so far does not any dependencies at all.

## Features

Well, so far not much ^-^"
But it's the very start of this project.

I already reimplemented an equivalent of `GetModuleHandle()` and `GetProcAddress()` as well as all the structures needed
to make it work (and a bit more even).

I'm now working on dynamically retrieving syscalls SSNs, so that i can put all pieces together.
This project is kinda like my journal of learning about malware, i plan to keep on building on it and adding more
features as I learn new things.

Feel free to browse the code, I took care to document absolutely everything, so it shouldn't be that hard to understand.

## Usage

## Why rust ?

¯\_(ツ)_/¯ I just think its neat

As previously stated, I wanted to learn new things so why not try something else than the usual C/C++ maldev projects.

## License

Nah, just take it

## (obligatory) Disclaimer

Just don't be evil.
This may be a malware development project, the primary goal is to understand the workings of windows internals and learn
various evasion techniques, not to attack anything.
