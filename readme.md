# Thermite: Offensive Rust

A malware development project written entirely in Rust.

Despite the presentation as a library, my only goal making this was to learn, 
I never really planned for it to be public and I will probably not maintain it regularly, so expect bugs and broken functionnalities. 

However, do note that all [the examples](/examples/readme.md) included in the repository work and have been tested. 

## Summary

What is done yet ?

* **PEB Walking** and enumeration using custom implementation of GetModuleHandle/GetProcAddress
* **Direct syscalls** with dynamic syscall ID retrieval using a mix of techniques such as Hell's Gates and Halo's Gate/Tartarus gate.
* **Indirect syscalls** (now with syscall sorting to retrieve SSNs ! (a.k.a FreshyCalls))
* **API Hooking** using **Hardware breakpoints** - (Patchless AMSI Bypass using this technique)

I am also currently working on various other techniques such as process enumeration, etw/amsi patching, PPID spoofing etcâ€¦ Everything is not online yet, but I try to update the repository as regularly as possible.

I suggest checking [the examples](/examples/readme.md), as most functionnalities are demonstrated by examples, but there's still quite a few that remains undocumented so I highly recommand to go check out the code by yourself.

In addition, I took a lot of care to **document everything** by **writing detailed comments and documentation**. The goal of this project is to teach myself malware development, and **knowledge is meant to be shared <3**

For this reason I invite anyone interested to go check out the code, I learned a lot while making this, maybe you could too.

Nah, take it, just star the repo if you do :star:
